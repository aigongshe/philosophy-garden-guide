## Stage 2: Channel Layout & Content Structuring

With the foundational settings in place, we now need to optimize the visitor's experience on your channel homepage. The goal is to guide them to immerse themselves in your content, which is crucial for increasing watch time and subscription conversion rates.

**Action Path:**
Go to `YouTube Studio` -> `Customization` -> `Layout`

### 1. Video Spotlight

This section is the "prime real estate" of your channel homepage.

*   **Channel trailer (for people who haven't subscribed):**
    *   **Goal:** To use a short video (30-60 seconds) to quickly convey your core value and give new visitors a strong reason to subscribe.
    *   **Recommendation:** Choose a video that is highly representative of your channel's theme and is very engaging. For example, **"In the AI Era, Do You Really Know How to Ask Questions?"** is an excellent choice as it immediately sparks curiosity.

*   **Featured video (for returning subscribers):**
    *   **Goal:** To showcase your latest or most important content to your loyal, subscribed fans.
    *   **Recommendation:** Set this to your most recent upload, or the first episode of a new series you want to promote.

### 2. Featured Sections

This is the key step to link your individual videos into a cohesive "body of knowledge." We achieve this by creating **Playlists**.

*   **Goal:** To categorize your 300+ videos, creating structured learning paths. This can dramatically increase session watch time.
*   **Recommended Playlists to Create:**
    1.  **`【Must-Watch】Core Ideas & Methods`**: A selection of your most important and popular videos, serving as a starting guide for new users.
    2.  **`Philosophical Thinking: From Beginner to Advanced`**: Gathers all videos on philosophical, critical, and logical thinking.
    3.  **`Business Wisdom & Excellent Leadership`**: Gathers all videos on business models, management, decision-making, and leadership.
    4.  **`Cognition & Growth in the AI Era`**: Gathers all videos on artificial intelligence, future skills, and personal growth.
    5.  **`Life Cultivation: Emotions & Relationships`**: Gathers all videos on psychology, emotional management, and interpersonal skills.

*   **Your Task:** Please take some time to organize your published videos and add them to these playlists. This is a high-value organizational effort.

### 3. Branding Tab

Under the "Branding" tab in Customization, there is one more small but important setting.

*   **Video watermark:**
    *   **Goal:** To provide a persistent, clickable subscribe button in the bottom-right corner of all your videos.
    *   **Recommendation:** Upload a simple square image (it can be your profile picture or a button that says "Subscribe"). For the "Display time," select **`Entire video`**.

### **Stage 2 Optimization Blueprint (Based on Your Current Settings)**

**Step 3: Add the "Featured Playlist" Sections**:
   - Click `+ Add section`, then select `Single playlist`.
   - Following this **golden order**, add the playlists you have created one by one:
     1.  **Section 1:** Playlist - `【Must-Watch】Core Ideas & Methods`

## Stage 3: Completing Channel Information

Let's continue to meticulously refine the channel's professional image.

**Action Path:**
Go to `YouTube Studio` -> `Customization` -> `Basic info`

### 1. Pronouns

*   **Goal:** To clearly state your personal pronouns, which is a modern, open, and respectful professional gesture.
*   **Recommendation:**
    1.  **Add Chinese Pronouns:** Enter `他`, and set visibility to `Visible to everyone`.
    2.  **Add English Pronouns:** Enter `He/Him`, and also set visibility to `Visible to everyone`.

### 2. Links

*   **Goal:** To provide clear traffic gateways on your channel banner and build your brand ecosystem.
*   **Recommendation:**
    1.  **Optimize Existing Link:** Change the title from `欢迎来到哲学的花园` to `Official Website`.
    2.  **Add New Links (Recommended Order):**
        *   **Link 2:** Title: `Philosophy Garden Guide`, URL: `https://philosophy-garden-guide.vercel.app`
        *   **Link 3:** Title: `Business Inquiries`, URL: `mailto:[Your Email Address Here]`
        *   **Link 4:** Title: `LinkedIn`, URL: `[Your LinkedIn Profile URL]`

## Stage 4: Designing Channel Visuals

Visual identity is the first impression of your channel, and the Banner Image is particularly crucial. It needs to maintain professionalism and appeal across all devices.

**Action Path:**
Go to `YouTube Studio` -> `Customization` -> `Branding` -> `Banner image`

### 1. Core Rule for Banner Design: The Safe Area

The challenge with YouTube Banner design is that it displays at different sizes across various devices (TV, desktop, tablet, mobile). You upload one large image, but only a narrow, central area is visible on all devices. This area is what we must firmly grasp: the **"Safe Area"**.

**Key Dimension Rules:**

1.  **Ideal Canvas Size:**
    *   **`2560 x 1440` pixels**. This is the full size prepared for TV screens. Please create your design file at this dimension.

2.  **Desktop Viewable Area:**
    *   Approximately `2560 x 423` pixels. Users on desktop will see a wider strip in the middle.

3.  **Mobile Safe Area - ✨Most Important✨:**
    *   **`1546 x 423` pixels**. This is the core area located precisely in the center of the entire canvas. **All your critical information – your name, logo, core tagline, your photo – must be placed entirely within this area** to ensure perfect display on mobile phones.

### 2. Tailored Design Concepts for Your Channel

Based on your channel's positioning (philosophy, business, wisdom), I have conceived two design directions for you:

#### Concept A: The Thinker

*   **Style:** Professional, composed, profound.
*   **Background (Entire 2560x1440 Canvas):**
    *   Use a high-quality, dark textured background, such as dark gray slate, fine paper texture, or a deep blue starry sky.
*   **Safe Area (1546x423) Content:**
    *   **Left or Right Side:** Place a professional, high-quality photo of yourself (Guo Chunlin), perhaps in a thoughtful pose.
    *   **Other Side:** Place the core text, clearly laid out.
        *   **Main Title (Large Font):** `Guo Chunlin`
        *   **Subtitle (Smaller Font):** `Philosophical Thinking | Business Wisdom | Personal Growth`

#### Concept B: The Garden of Wisdom

*   **Style:** Abstract, elegant, thought-provoking.
*   **Background (Entire 2560x1440 Canvas):**
    *   Use a beautiful, abstract background image that evokes "wisdom" or "connection." For example, tech-inspired neural network lines, stylized botanical patterns, or flowing light.
*   **Safe Area (1546x423) Content:**
    *   以精美的排版为主，将文字放在正中心。
        *   **主标题 (优雅的衬线字体):** `The Garden of Wisdom`
        *   **副标题 (现代的无衬线字体):** `Guo Chunlin`
        *   **标语 (更小的字体):** `Illuminate the Path of Life with Wisdom`
